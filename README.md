In the spirit of open source, it's you who decide on what content will be available on Data Platform Academy.
Examples, code snippets, exercises are available for **free for anyone**.

Hop on and let's take it to the next level.

* Each course is designed to be a **6-week *Zero-To-Hero* Program**
* No fluff, straight to the point, short, **actionable** lessons
* Weekly check-ins and challenges
* Group Coaching Calls (Zoom/Teams/Discord) with world-class experts.

How is it any different from all those *online courses* you'll find on Udemy, Coursesra or Youtube? 

1. Those so-called *"Experts"* think they know better. You sign up, you pay for a course and then half of it is something you already know, and the other is either a filler or unrelated to real-world scenarios.
2. You have complete control over how the courses are being developed - starting with the agenda below: I am asking you: what do __YOU__ need to know? And then I will hire world-class experts to deliver the content that will make you grow and master Data Platform - regardless if you want to become Data Egineer, Scientist, Analyst, Administrator or Developer.
